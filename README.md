# Hello Zig!

Zig is a fascinating new programming language that I feel sits somewhere between C and Rust. Re-ading through it you can find Rust inspirations almost everywhere but its much closer to C and other C-based languages when reading the flow and logic of the code. As someone whose struggled immensely with learning Rust, despite being a relatively experienced programmer, I've decided to give Zig a try.
