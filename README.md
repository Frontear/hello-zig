# Hello Zig!

Zig is a fascinating new programming language that I feel sits somewhere between C and Rust. Re-ading through it you can find Rust inspirations almost everywhere but its much closer to C and other C-based languages when reading the flow and logic of the code. As someone whose struggled immensely with learning Rust, despite being a relatively experienced programmer, I've decided to give Zig a try.

## Post-Installation

Take a look at `src/main.zig` for detailed comments about what Zig is doing and why its doing what its doing.
You may run the following `make` tasks to have things happen (see the code for them in the Makefile):
- `make`/`make all`: Build and run the Zig project
- `make build`: Build into a compiled executable
- `make docs`: Generate documentation for the program (at `docs/index.html`)
